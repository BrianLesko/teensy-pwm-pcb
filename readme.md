# Teensy 4.0 PWM pcb

**My go-to board for servo motor and ESC control** 
This compact PCB design and 3dprinted mount brings power rails parallel to your teensy 4.0 microcontroller. Any 3-pin Futaba J connector can plug right into your teensy. Intended for use in robotics projects.

## Why use a PCB

Sure, you ***could*** bend long headers and solder everything by hand—but that’s time-consuming and error-prone.

The pcb files here were made with [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org). 

## 3d Printed Mount 

The print needs high accuracy because this setup is so compact. Its smaller than most RC gyro units. 

## PWM
